## Hello Everyone! I'm Dominic! I appreciate you taking the time to check out my portfolio!

#### I am a recent graduate from the University of Virginia, where I double majored in Statistics and German Studies and continued my studies to receive my masters in Statistics. My academic journey has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of statistical methodologies, bolstered by a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and German Studies, and further solidified through the successful completion of my Master's degree in Statistics. Proficient in a suite of analytical tools, including R, Python, SQL, Tableau, AWS, and Excel, I am well-prepared to contribute to the dynamic field of data science. My approach to data extends beyond numerical interpretation; it is grounded in the art of extracting meaningful narratives from datasets. I take pride in my ability to apply statistical principles with discernment, understanding not just the "how" but also the "when" to employ specific methodologies for impactful insights.
