## Hello Everyone! I'm Dominic! I appreciate you taking the time to check out my portfolio!

#### I am a recent graduate from the University of Virginia, where I double majored in Statistics and German Studies and continued my studies to receive my masters in Statistics. My academic journey has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of statistical methodologies, bolstered by a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and German Studies, and further solidified through the successful completion of my Master's degree in Statistics. Proficient in a suite of analytical tools, including R, Python, SQL, Tableau, AWS, and Excel, I am well-prepared to contribute to the dynamic field of data science. My approach to data extends beyond numerical interpretation; it is grounded in the art of extracting meaningful narratives from datasets. I take pride in my ability to apply statistical principles with discernment, understanding not just the "how" but also the "when" to employ specific methodologies for impactful insights.

### [Classification and Regression of Student Performance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/169ATQx2SRKDx49DhJt7wjZYLpIPAsfSEtMlmR4sLo9k/edit?usp=sharing)

Using the Student Performance Dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository I utilized regression methods such as lasso and ridge regression to predict the final grades of students on a scale from 1-20. Utilized Classification Methods such as logistic regression and random forest to predict whether or not a student would receive a passing grade (>10). Obtained an maximum accuracy rate of 86.36% and a minimum RMSE of 2.541. Analyzed covariates to determine which variables that were associated with enhanced student performance.

### [Drug Shortage Prediction](/assets/Matriccino, Dominic Writing Sample.pdf)


This comprehensive report delves into the intricate landscape of drug shortages within the pharmaceutical industry, with a particular focus on the implications for generic drug manufacturers. It elucidates the process of drug patenting and expiration, detailing how exclusive rights granted during patent periods safeguard pharmaceutical companies but eventually open avenues for generic drug production. The protracted research and development phase, spanning 10-15 years, demands substantial resources, necessitating assurances of profitable market entry post-development. The report underscores the critical role played by patents in fostering competition when they expire, leading to a decrease in drug prices. Drawing attention to the link between manufacturing issues and drug shortages, the document introduces a strategic project undertaken by Picket, a pharmaceutical company specializing in generic drugs. Picket aims to unravel the intricacies of shortage dynamics through regression models predicting the frequency and duration of shortages for specific drug classes. Logistic regression is employed to predict shortages, while Poisson regression tackles the frequency and duration of shortages. The report reveals that certain drug attributes significantly influence the likelihood and characteristics of shortages, emphasizing the importance of leveraging these insights for informed market entry decisions. Ultimately, the report advocates for a nuanced understanding of shortage patterns to optimize business strategies and alleviate the impact of drug shortages on patient care.

This mouse experiment investigates the impact of an inflammation-causing mutation on the tibia size of mice. Two groups of mice, with and without the mutation, were examined, spanning different genetic backgrounds. The mutation's significance became evident: it strongly correlated with shorter tibial lengths. Additionally, the genetic backgrounds exhibited notable differences, with A-background mice generally larger even when accounting for the mutation. Gender played an insignificant role. While a pairwise t-test highlighted significant differences among most strains, further analyses were needed. The mutation appears to influence smaller tibias, possibly due to inflammation-induced effects on development. This study offers insights into mutation effects, with scope for more comprehensive exploration.
